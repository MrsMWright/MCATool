We are pleased to make the MCA web based assessment tool available for organisations to use.  
The tool was developed from funding from the Nurse Technology Fund, and we are required to show its effectiveness. 
We have developed questionnaires to use with staff before and after using the assessment tool to assess 
changes in knowledge, confidence and satisfaction in undertaking Mental Capacity Act assessments.  
We are making this tool available via Open Source on the proviso that organisations agree to use 
these questionnaires and send back the completed questionnaires and demographic information. Completed sets of questionnaires 
(Demographic and pre and post Knowledge, Confidence and Satisfaction questionnaires for each person) 
should be sent to
